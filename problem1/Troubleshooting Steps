Troubleshooting an issue with web pages failing to load

1. Check the network interface configuration (ifconfig) or IP addressing (ip addr) - ensure that IP address and subnet mask are configured and valid. It appears they are.
2. Try pinging a URL (for example, github.com). This is successful from my client.
3. If that fails, check the server's DNS records (cat /etc/resolv.conf): this file will list the DNS servers configured, in this case 10.0.0.201 and 10.0.0.247   Try pinging these addresses. In my case, it fails!
4. It appears that both configured DNS servers for this environment are unreachable. Further troubleshooting should be done to determine:
  -whether they are shut down
  -whether they are not available on the network
  -whether there is some firewall rule that is blocking communication
  -whether the DNS service is running
